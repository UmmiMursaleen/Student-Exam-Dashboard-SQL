Built and deployed a Student Exam Dashboard using Python, powered by PostgreSQL for database management and Streamlit for visualization.

The dashboard connects to the database through SQLAlchemy and leverages Pandas for efficient data manipulation and presentation. It provides a comprehensive view of student performance by filtering results based on Year, Semester, Batch, and Course. A key feature is the automated calculation of student failure rate (%) in each course â€” enabling quick insights for better academic decision-making.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack: Python | PostgreSQL | SQLAlchemy | Pandas | Streamlit

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

   â€¢	Dynamic filtering by year, semester, batch, and course
    
  â€¢	Automated calculation of student failure rate (%)
    
  â€¢	Clear visualization of marks, grades, and pass/fail status.
    
  â€¢	Interactive, user-friendly interface for analytics

This project shows how data analytics can support academics in understanding student performance more effectively and guide strategies for improvement.
